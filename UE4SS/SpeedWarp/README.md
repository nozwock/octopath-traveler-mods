# Speed Warp
Automatically increases game speed during combat and allows cycling through a list of speeds, with configuration support.

## Usage
In and out of combat, you can cycle through different game speeds using the `GameSpeedCycle` key, set to `F8` by default.

The option to automatically increase game speed during combat (and only in turn resolution) is enabled by default.

Settings can be customized in the [settings.lua](SpeedWarp/Scripts/settings.lua) file. The settings file looks like this:
